Svelte 5 is the next incarnation of Svelte. It's the culmination of our learnings over the course of five years.

On first look a lot of things have changed between version 3/4 and 5. But on a closer look you will find a lot of similarities, many unchanged parts of the syntax, and hopefully the same familiar feeling that got you into Svelte.

This tutorial is meant for people who already know Svelte and are upgrading to Svelte 5. It will go through each of the syntax changes along with explanations of why we did it. For a complete list of all changes (however tiny they are) head over to _TODO LINK TO LIST OF BREAKING CHANGES_.
